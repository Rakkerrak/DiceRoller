# DiceRoller
Beginner python project that rolls starting stats for D&amp;D 5e

All stuff that belongs to Wizards of the Coast(class descriptions, weapon/feat descriptions etc.) belongs to them. Use at your own risk anything that incluedes anything remotely looking proprietary. I don't know if they care.

I'm just having fun and thought I'd share it.

I also don't know how github works yet but you can just copy paste the stuff in your own files for all I care and run it through python3.  dice.py is the start file. Until I rename it to something more normal.
